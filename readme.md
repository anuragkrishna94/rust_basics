# What is covered?
- Covers very basics of Rust (Chapters 1 - 4 from the Rust book).
- **Ownership & Borrowing** examples are covered. This could be a recap if you've already read the theory but haven't gotten your hands dirty with those concepts.

# What Input to give while running the code
- Input that needs to be given should be 
  > **an integer between 0..4**
- This is so because the array `a` defined has an index of **5**.
